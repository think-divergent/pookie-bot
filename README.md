# Development Notes
## Add new slack events
Make sure to add the list of events to [Event Subscriptions](https://api.slack.com/apps/A01HWT3TYCA/event-subscriptions)
During development, slack bot uses bot token, if the event requires additional scopes, they need to be added [here](https://api.slack.com/apps/A01T0HFLTUH/oauth)
